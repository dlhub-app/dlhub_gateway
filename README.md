## What is DLHub Gateway?
DLHub Gateway is just a copy of the official Jupyter Kernel Gateway with minor changes to make it
more easy-to-use for DLHub.app users. The majority of the files in this repository is exactly an
unchanged copy from jupyter/kernel_gateway repository. We have just changed few files to make it
more accessible, especially for our Windows users.

## What is DLHub.app?
DLHub.app is a web application which helps the users to design and work on deep learning projects
using visual programming. The main idea is that the users can connect the online app to a Jupyter
Kernel Gateway which is running locally on the user's machine; and then  they run the visually
programed codes on this gateway.
